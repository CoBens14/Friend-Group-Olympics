<p>The events listed below are confirmed to be taking place during the Olympics. More events can be added. Dates and times
    will be determined and added to the schedule as the events get nearer. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Among Us</li>
    <li>Badminton</li>
    <li>Golf</li>
    <li>Pickleball</li>
    <li>Pool</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The events below will be considered, but may not be included if time, cost, access to facilities/equipment, or lack
    of enthusiasm or interest prevents them from taking place. If you feel strongly about any of the sports below being 
    included, I encourage you to vouch for it and find details such as what times they could be done, cost or lack thereof,
    and any other important details and send those to me. Coming up with a plan to make it happen will go a long way.
    For example, we could probably play foosball at the same time as pool, as both would take place in the game room. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Basketball</li>
    <li>Bowling</li>
    <li>Dodgeball</li>
    <li>Foosball</li>
    <li>Swimming</ul>
</ul>
<p>
    The list below are events that were offered up by somebody and if you think they are good ideas, we could do these as
    well. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chess</li>
    <li>Gaga Ball(I have zero clue what this is. Seems like weird dodgeball)</li>
    <li>Mario Kart(I could provide Switch but I don't think I own Mario Kart)</li>
    <li>Rock Climbing</li>
    
</ul>
