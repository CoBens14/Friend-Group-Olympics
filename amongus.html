<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>The gold medal winner of Among Us was Lindsey, with Grant and Saya sharing second place silver. The competition
    had nine competitors, the most of any competition so far. Some issues with disconnections and a room change
    hampered the event, but it was still a good time. The best use of the shapeshifter goes to Grant. The worst 
    ability to communicate also goes to Grant. Colton was imposter the most and also had the most disconnects.
