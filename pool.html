<p>Pool will take place on Sunday, February 25th at 6pm. The bracket is located below. The team on the top of the 
    bracket will break for each round. Partners and matchups were randomly chosen. A legal break requires four balls to hit the rail or for a ball to go
    into a pocket. We will be playing by "slop" rules, meaning you don't need to call shots. Other standard pool
    <a href="https://www.tribilliards.com/information/official-8-ball-rules.html">rules</a> will apply with certain
    exceptions. We will go over the rules we will play by before the games begin. Time and available tables will
    dictate whether there is a third place game.
