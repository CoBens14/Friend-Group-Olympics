<p>Pickleball will take place on Sunday, March 3rd at 2pm. It will be on the far north practice tennis courts.
    The bracket is located below. Apologies for the poor quality, for some reason I was having issues getting this image to 
    scale correctly and lost some of the quality trying to fix it. We will attempt to play a double 
    elimination tournament if time allows. All standard pickleball rules will be covered prior to the start of the event.

<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>The headline of the event was a blowing wind that kept players on edge, and a marching band competition that kept the games 
    outside. However, the games went on with a live band performance and a passing train. 
    Grant had an outstanding day, dominating on his way to a gold medal and the overall individual points lead. Alexa had another
    strong performance, finishing with silver and propeling herself into third place overall. Colton rounded out the 
    medal placement with bronze. It was a rough day for Team Chicago, which saw both team members bow out early.
