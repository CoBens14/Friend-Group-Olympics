<p>Pickleball will take place on Sunday, March 3rd at 2pm. It will be on the far north practice tennis courts.
    The bracket is located below. Apologies for the poor quality, for some reason I was having issues getting this image to 
    scale correctly and lost some of the quality trying to fix it. We will attempt to play a double 
    elimination tournament if time allows. All standard pickleball rules will be covered prior to the start of the event.
