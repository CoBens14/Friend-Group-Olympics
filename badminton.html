<h1 class="pgtitle">Badminton</h1>
<p>Badminton will take place on Friday, February 2nd in the Auxillary Gym located in the basement of the Bear Athletic Center. To get there, walk in the Bear from the main doors on 
    the south of the building. Then walk straight and take a right. Take the stairs down that are right next to the weight and cardio gym. From there, follow the signs to the 
    Auxillary Gym. This event will be the first event of the Olympics. The bracket 
    is located below. With this being the first event, it was decided that each group of partners should be based on their teams. Seeding was done randomly. It will be a single 
    elimination tournament, so every team will play twice, with a third place game also being played prior to the championship game if time allows.

<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Badminton saw mostly domination, mainly by Team Chicago who took gold, but also by Team West Coast with silver.
    Team Minnesota won two close games over Team Hometown Heroes to take bronze. It was a great event that saw 
    lots of improvement among the competitors, many of which lacked any or significant badminton experience. It 
    was also the first event of the Olympics and set an exciting tone for the rest of the events.
