        Hello, I hope you are having a great winter break and final grades were nice to all of you. Unfortunately, there are 
        only two weeks until classes start back up. The good news is that means we are getting closer to the start of the
        Olympics. This update includes the announced time of the opening ceremony, which will take place January 26th at 
        7pm. Pizza will hopefully be provided. It also includes five confirmed events, which can be found on the new events tab at the top of the navigation
        bar. Enjoy the next two weeks!

    <p>Merry Christmas! The website has launched as we are four weeks out from the start of spring semester. The first order of
    business for all visitors of this webpage is to complete the survey by January 2nd, which can be found on the 
    <a class="text" href="survey.html">survey page.</a> After that, more updates will be posted with the time of the 
    opening ceremony and the first couple of events added to the schedule.</p>
