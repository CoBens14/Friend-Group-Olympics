<h4>Updated as of: March 3rd</h4>
<p>After another strong performance from Grant which puts him first individually, Team West Coast has taken the lead in 
    the competition after 4 events. Team 
    Chicago is not far behind, sitting one point back after a tough day on the windy pickleball courts. Alexa also moved 
    herself up the rankings, and helped distance Team Minnesota ahead of last place Team Hometown Heroes. The last event 
    prior to Spring Break has been played, with more events to come in a few weeks. Until then, Team West Coast and Grant 
    will have bragging rights.
