<h4>Updated as of: February 29th</h4>
<p>The competition is heating up, with Team Chicago still in the lead behind several strong performances from Lindsey. 
    Team West Coast sits in second, with Grant also in second place individually. With another event coming up in just a few
    days, expect even more shakeup with the results as close as they currently are.
